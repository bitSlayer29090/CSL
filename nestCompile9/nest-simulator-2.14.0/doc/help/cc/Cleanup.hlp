Name: Cleanup - cleanup the network after a simulation

Synopsis:

Cleanup ->	-


Description:

tears down a network after run is called 
any number of times 
Note: Run must only be used after Prepare is called, and 
before Cleanup to finalize state (close files, etc).

undefined behavior and incorrect results.
