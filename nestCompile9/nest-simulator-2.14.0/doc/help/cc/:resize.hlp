Name: :resize - Change the internal size of an array.

Synopsis:

array n resize -> array.


Description:

resize changes the size of the supplied array 
independent of the current capacity. 
resize is used to free memory by shrinking arrays whose capacity 
has grown too large. 
If the new size is smaller than the array, the trailing elements 
are lost.
